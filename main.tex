\section{Introduction}
In the initial stages, railway signaling depended on human operators and telephonic communications to coordinate between stations, crucial for ensuring safety; however, with technological advancements, ATP systems have significantly enhanced protection, safety, and efficiency in railway operations.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.20, angle=0]{Imagenes_general/ATP_Architecture_Metro_Quito_1.pdf}}
    \caption{ATP Architecture diagram}
    \label{ATP Architecture diagram}
\end{figure}

The Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system forms the foundation of modern railway signaling systems. It has evolved to meet the critical demands for train integrity verification and precise, real-time location tracking. This is achieved through continuous Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) communication between trackside and onboard equipment, significantly enhancing safety and efficiency on the rails. Figure [\ref{ATP Architecture diagram}]

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, scale=0.90]{Imagenes_general/esquema_general_arquitectura_CBTC_1.pdf}}
    \caption{CBTC Architecture diagram}
    \label{CBTC Architecture diagram}
\end{figure}

CBTC system supports several levels of automation, including driverless train operations, and offers advantages such as increased service reliability, energy efficiency, and system scalability. This system enables more precise train control using the moving block principle, which dynamically adjusts the safe distance between trains based on their speed and braking capacity, unlike the fixed block system, which divides the track into fixed sections for safety but limits operational capacity and train proximity. In the IEEE 1474.1-2004 standard, it is more detailed. Figure [\ref{CBTC Architecture diagram}]

In Urban Guided Transport (UGT), the degree of automation ranges from manual to autonomous operation (GoA0 to GoA4 according to UNE-EN-62290-1), include intermediate levels of assistance and automatic operation, with variations in human intervention and the technology used.

The Automatic Train Protection (ATP) and the Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) systems operate individually to constantly monitor the speed and location of trains, ensuring safe and adaptive operations in response to changes in traffic and track conditions, which minimizes human intervention and reduces the risk of accidents. ATP ensures that trains maintain safe distances, and beside this, CBTC allows operations at shorter intervals, thereby increasing service frequency and optimizing the efficiency of the existing infrastructure. The integration of these systems enhances diagnostics and problem resolution, facilitating faster maintenance and reduced costs. These benefits offset the high initial cost of implementation, resulting in significant long-term savings. This advanced configuration not only strengthens the safety and capacity of the trains but also optimizes operational efficiency, making it a strategic investment to improve operations and passenger service.

The objectives of this article:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Evaluate the current capabilities of railway signaling systems in Ecuador and determine the operational needs that could be met by implementing CBTC and ATP technologies.
\item Examine the impact of adopting CBTC and ATP systems on optimizing railway headway, aiming to significantly increase the efficiency and operational capacity of the railway systems in Ecuador.
\item Provide recommendations for identifying and categorizing the technical, financial, and regulatory obstacles faced by the implementation of CBTC and ATP systems in Ecuador's railway sector.
\end{itemize}

\section{Railway Projects in Ecuador}

In Ecuador, railway projects are increasingly taking a central role in efforts to modernize transportation infrastructure and efficiently connect various regions and cities of the country, thereby revitalizing both the local economy and access to essential services.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Imagenes_general/Timeline railway Guayaquil - Quito_1.pdf}
    \caption{Timeline Ecuadorian Regional train}
    \label{fig:timeline_train_reg}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Regional train}

Between 1872 and 1930, Ecuador significantly expanded its railway network, focusing on internal integration and the transport of agricultural products and passengers. However, growth ceased in 1930, leading to centralized administration and current use primarily for tourism, with notable routes including Alausí-Sibambe and Quito-El Boliche-Machachi. Figure[\ref{fig:timeline_train_reg}]


\subsection{Tramway de los Cuatro Rios}

Cuenca, renowned for its colonial architecture and vibrant urban life, initiated a tram project during the 2009-2014 period with a budget of 180 million dollars, aimed at revitalizing urban mobility and facing challenges such as delays and criticisms, yet emerging as a symbol of modernity and effective management. Figure [\ref{fig:timeline_train_cu}]

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, scale=0.50]{Imagenes_general/Tranvía de Cuenca_en.pdf}
    \caption{Timeline Tram Cuenca}
    \label{fig:timeline_train_cu}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Metro de Quito}

Quito, the capital of Ecuador, is advancing sustainable urban development with its inaugural Metro project, aiming to alleviate congestion through efficient and eco-friendly transportation, facing technical and financial challenges, yet promising to transform mobility and urban life. Figure [\ref{Timeline Metro Quito}]

\begin{figure}[ht]                                     
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, scale=0.50]{Imagenes_general/Metro de Quito_en.pdf}}
    \caption{Timeline Metro Quito}                     
    \label{Timeline Metro Quito}                                                 
\end{figure} 

Finally, Ecuador's railway projects, such as the Regional Train, the Cuenca Tram, and the Quito Metro, represent significant advances in the country's transportation infrastructure. Specifically, the Quito Metro, with its implementation of ATP system, demonstrates a strong commitment to safety and efficiency. Adopting even more advanced systems could lead to further improvements in reliability, capacity, and safety, while simultaneously optimizing costs and maintenance. These improvements would not only strengthen the transportation network but also increase user confidence and satisfaction.

\section{Methodology}
The following analysis used the Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) [ref] method to characterize processes or components in specific variables, with the objective of evaluating ATP systems and CBTC systems in metropolitan urban transportation. This facilitates comparative assessments and observations of the following characteristics: reliability, safety, capacity, maintenance and costs through graphical representation.

\caption{Reliability Analysis}
 \label{fig:Reliability Analysis}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Reliability}
The reliability of ATP relies on components like balises and speed controllers for flexible operation, while CBTC requires flawless execution of sophisticated systems like positioning and wireless communication to ensure exceptional adaptability and reliability, with both systems emphasizing the critical role of effective communication in smooth railway operations. Figure [\ref{fig:Reliability Analysis}]\\
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering

    \includegraphics[width=0.13\textwidth,scale=1]{Imagenes_general/Tabla_Safety.png}
    \caption{Safety Analysis}
    \label{fig:Safety Analysis}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Safety}
ATP systems rely on traditional components and driver responses for safety, whereas CBTC systems use advanced positioning and communication technologies for more autonomous operation, with CBTC also excelling in adaptability and scalability by integrating technological advancements to enhance safety and reliability. Figure [\ref{fig:Safety Analysis}]\\
\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.20\textwidth,scale=1]{Imagenes_general/Tabla_Capability.png}
    \caption{Capability Analysis}
    \label{fig:Capability Analysis}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Capability}
ATP systems are limited in modernization due to reliance on established signaling and manual processes, while CBTC systems, supported by real-time sensors within a robust communication framework, excel in automated capacity, adaptability, and scalability to meet advancing railway demands. Figure [\ref{fig:Capability Analysis}]\\
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.27\textwidth,scale=1]{Imagenes_general/Gráfico_Maintenece.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth,scale=1]{Imagenes_general/Tabla_Maintenece.jpg}
    \caption{Maintenance Analysis}
    \label{fig:Maintenance Analysis}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Maintenance}
Maintenance of ATP systems is challenged by aging components and fixed signaling, complicating updates, whereas CBTC systems benefit from a modern, modular design and software reliance, easing upgrades and adapting to new technologies with an emphasis on real-time communication. Figure [\ref{fig:Maintenance Analysis}]\\

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.23\textwidth,scale=1]{Imagenes_general/Gráfico_costs.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.22\textwidth,scale=1]{Imagenes_general/tablas_costs.jpg}
    \caption{Costs Analysis}
    \label{fig:Costs Analysis}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Costs}
In railway systems cost analysis, ATP operates at lower costs due to simpler, existing technology and basic communication needs, while CBTC incurs higher costs owing to its use of advanced components and integrated communication systems, leading to complex cost assessments and greater overall expenses for implementation and future adaptability. [\ref{fig:Costs Analysis}]\\
The evaluation reveals that CBTC outperforms ATP across various critical parameters, notably demonstrating superior reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness.[\ref{fig:Analysis}]

An analysis was conducted on the grades of automation, taking into account the basic train operation functions in the Quito metro system with the current ATP, as well as the feasibility of conducting a study for the implementation of CBTC.

\subsection{UGT, Grade of  Automation }

In the table of the UNE-EN-62290-1 standard, which addresses the basic functions for determining the grades of automation, the following is analyzed: the gray columns are not in effect to the current mass transportation system in Quito, the yellow column represents the grade of automation implemented in Quito's Metro, and the green columns represent the potential CBTC system that could be implemented in metropolitan urban transport.

\subsection{Headway in Railway Signaling }

The term "headway" refers to the interval between consecutive trains on the same track, crucial for the capacity and safety of rail transport. CBTC (Communications-Based Train Control) systems significantly improve headway through continuous communication between trains and the control center, real-time adjustable virtual blocks, and Automatic Train Operation (ATO), optimizing frequency and capacity, as seen in the Beijing Metro and the Las Vegas Monorail.\cite{b8}  In contrast, ATP (Automatic Train Protection) systems, like those in the Metro Quito  and Metro Lima, have a higher and less efficient headway.\cite{b9} 

A study was conducted on the railway headway and its impact on the operation of the mass transit system (Metro de Quito) by varying the conditions specified in Table[\ref{table:simulations}], creating several simulation cases that will help visualize the results.

\section*{Discussions and future research}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
